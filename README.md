# Enhancing Quality Control in Battery Component Manufacturing: Deep Learning-based Approaches for Defect Detection on Micro Fasteners
This repository contains all source code and results for detecting defects and enhancing quality control on the Micro fasteners study.


ABSTRACT. The management of product quality is a crucial process in factory manufacturing. However, this approach still has some limitations, e.g., depending on the expertise of the engineer in evaluating products and being time-consuming. Various approaches using deep learning in automatic defect detection and classification during production have been introduced to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we study applying different deep learning approaches and computer vision methods to detect defects on the surface of micro fasteners used in rechargeable batteries. Furthermore, we introduce an architecture with statistical quality control (SQC) to continuously improve the efficiency and accuracy of product quality inspection. The proposed architecture takes advantage of the capability of deep learning approaches, computer vision techniques, and SQC to automate the defect detection process and quality improvement. The proposed approach is evaluated using a real dataset comprising 1150 micro fastener surface images obtained from a factory in Korea. In the study, we compare the direct and indirect prediction methods for predicting the defects on the surface of the product and achieve the best accuracy of 0.91 with the indirect prediction approach. Notably, the indirect prediction method is more efficient than the traditional one. Furthermore, using control charts in SQC to analyze predicted defects in the production process helps operators understand the efficiency of the production line and make appropriate decisions in the manufacturing process, hen improves product quality management.
